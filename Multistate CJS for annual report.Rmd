## Really, detection should depend on observers - but we have so many different people, didn't record well who did what, we semi-changed the strategy of digging around with metal detector or just digging in the dirt to find every tag. As plants died, tags might not mean there is a plant so we switched to looking for plants, then figuring out which tag they are associated with... So maybe time is a good proxy for 'trap' measures.
